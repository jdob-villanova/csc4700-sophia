Homegrown - Zac Brown Band

I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun, warm up the Georgia pine
Been so good to me, takin' it easy
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Live in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need, and nothin' that I don't
Homegrown

We got a fire goin', down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out them bottle, livin' like we'll never die
C'mon and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Live in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need, and nothin' that I don't

Live in a small town where it feels like home
I got everything I need (homegrown)
And nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Everything I need (homegrown)

It's the way that you carry for the things you think you want
It's the way that you carry for the things you think you want
(The way that you carry)
It's the way that you carry for the things you think you want
I got everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
Oh, everything I need, and nothin' that I don't (homegrown)
